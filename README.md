The pharmaceutical company Sun Pharma is manufacturing a new batch of painkiller drugs, which are due for testing. Around 80,000 new products are created and need to be tested for their time of effect (which is measured as the time taken for the drug to completely cure the pain), as well as the quality assurance (which tells you whether the drug was able to do a satisfactory job or not).

Note : the questions are based on the concepts that youâ€™ve learnt in Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing. 
       This is a subjective assignment and hence, you are required to write the answers and submit them in a PDF file
